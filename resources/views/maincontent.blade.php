<h1>Five Headphone Songs Guaranteed to Blow Your Mind</h1>
<p>
    Headphone technology seems to be getting better every day.
    Recently, Ceekars (pronounced “seekers”) developed what it's
    calling the world’s first 4D headphones, and the aural experience
    is trippy, to say the least. The company recently reached out to
    Guitar World and asked us to suggest some music that would put
    their radically new concept to the test. We responded with the
    following five tracks. While these sound amazing using Ceekars 4D
    technology, they also sound great even using the most modest ear
    buds. Enjoy! Grateful Dead, “Unbroken Chain” This epic tune on the
    Dead’s From The Mars Hotel was so difficult for the band to play
    that it had to be recorded in carefully orchestrated sections.
    Filled with cascading piano licks, jazzy guitar runs that dance in
    both sides of the stereo spectrum and weird synth burbles that
    tease the top of the brain, it’s the perfect headphone
    experience—especially when you’re “Truckin’” where it’s legal.
